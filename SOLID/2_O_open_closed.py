# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

# The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (such as classes, modules, and 
# functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
# This means that we should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing code. This
# helps prevent unintended bugs and makes the system more maintainable. 
# üí° Key Idea: Instead of changing an existing class when adding new features, we should extend it
# (e.g., using inheritance or polymorphism).

# ‚ùå Violation Principle 

def get_animal_sound(animal):
    if animal.name == "lion":

    if animal.name == "cat":
        return "meow"
    # If we add a new animal (e.g., dog), we must modify this function. This breaks OCP.
