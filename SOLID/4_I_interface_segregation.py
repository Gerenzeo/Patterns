# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

# The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states:
# - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
# In other words, a class should not be required to implement methods it does not need. Instead, 
# large interfaces should be divided into smaller, more specialized ones.

# üí° Key Idea:
# - It is better to create several small interfaces rather than one large interface that forces classes to implement unnecessary methods.
# - Classes should implement only the methods they actually need.
# - This makes the system more flexible, easier to maintain, and less prone to changes.
